[View at Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/surveily/developer.dotnet)

# Development
Surveily teams use the *.sdk.dockerfile based images for all of their software development using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Containers enabled](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers). That way we ensure all developers use a consistent environment and toolset.

# Runtimes
Surveily teams use the *.runtime.dockerfile based images for all of their applications being released as Docker containers. That way we ensure all applications are clear of any development dependencies and clutter.
